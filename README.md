# MyChatApp 

MyChatApp is a P2P chat application built in java. I made this in 2016 after taking the class 'Parallel and Distributed Systems'. We were learning about P2P applications and I wanted to know more about them. So, that summer, I constructed this chat application to communicate with my sisters in their rooms since we did not have an outbound internet connection at the time.

The app uses a Model View Controller format for organizing its class structure, as well as Java swing libraries for the UI.

Open up the project and run it from the IDE to check it out.
Enter a group name and port when the prompt appears, as well as username- and you're ready
to get started.
